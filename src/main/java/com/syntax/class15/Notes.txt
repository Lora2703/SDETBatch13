What is a method:
I   t is a block of code (group of Java statements). It defines the behavior of a class.

Why we should use method:
    1) It helps us remove the duplicate code from our application. We just create a method and
    every time we need that logic we just call the method that contains the lofic.
    2) It also allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes the developmrnt of
    large application easier.

How to use Methods:
    1) We create the method inside a class
    2) We create an object of that class
    3) We call the method by writing the name of the object a dot name of the method
